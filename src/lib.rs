#![crate_name="ndarray"]
#![doc(html_root_url = "https://docs.rs/ndarray/0.12/")]

//! The `ndarray` crate provides an *n*-dimensional container for general elements
//! and for numerics.
//!
//! In *n*-dimensional we include for example 1-dimensional rows or columns,
//! 2-dimensional matrices, and higher dimensional arrays. If the array has *n*
//! dimensions, then an element in the array is accessed by using that many indices.
//! Each dimension is also called an *axis*.
//!
//! - **[`ArrayBase`](struct.ArrayBase.html)**:
//!   The *n*-dimensional array type itself.<br>
//!   It is used to implement both the owned arrays and the views; see its docs
//!   for an overview of all array features.<br>
//! - The main specific array type is **[`Array`](type.Array.html)**, which owns
//! its elements.
//!
//! ## Highlights
//!
//! - Generic *n*-dimensional array
//! - Slicing, also with arbitrary step size, and negative indices to mean
//!   elements from the end of the axis.
//! - Views and subviews of arrays; iterators that yield subviews.
//! - Higher order operations and arithmetic are performant
//! - Array views can be used to slice and mutate any `[T]` data using
//!   `ArrayView::from` and `ArrayViewMut::from`.
//! - `Zip` for lock step function application across two or more arrays or other
//!   item producers (`NdProducer` trait).
//!
//! ## Crate Status
//!
//! - Still iterating on and evolving the crate
//!   + The crate is continuously developing, and breaking changes are expected
//!     during evolution from version to version. We adopt the newest stable
//!     rust features if we need them.
//!   + Note that functions/methods/traits/etc. hidden from the docs are not
//!     considered part of the public API, so changes to them are not
//!     considered breaking changes.
//! - Performance:
//!   + Prefer higher order methods and arithmetic operations on arrays first,
//!     then iteration, and as a last priority using indexed algorithms.
//!   + The higher order functions like ``.map()``, ``.map_inplace()``,
//!     ``.zip_mut_with()``, ``Zip`` and ``azip!()`` are the most efficient ways
//!     to perform single traversal and lock step traversal respectively.
//!   + Performance of an operation depends on the memory layout of the array
//!     or array view. Especially if it's a binary operation, which
//!     needs matching memory layout to be efficient (with some exceptions).
//!   + Efficient floating point matrix multiplication even for very large
//!     matrices; can optionally use BLAS to improve it further.
//! - **Requires Rust 1.31**
//!
//! ## Crate Feature Flags
//!
//! The following crate feature flags are available. They are configured in your
//! `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! - `serde-1`
//!   - Optional, compatible with Rust stable
//!   - Enables serialization support for serde 1.0
//! - `rayon`
//!   - Optional, compatible with Rust stable
//!   - Enables parallel iterators, parallelized methods and [`par_azip!`].
//! - `blas`
//!   - Optional and experimental, compatible with Rust stable
//!   - Enable transparent BLAS support for matrix multiplication.
//!     Uses ``blas-src`` for pluggable backend, which needs to be configured
//!     separately.
//!
//! ## Documentation
//!
//! * The docs for [`ArrayBase`](struct.ArrayBase.html) provide an overview of
//!   the *n*-dimensional array type. Other good pages to look at are the
//!   documentation for the [`s![]`](macro.s.html) and
//!   [`azip!()`](macro.azip.html) macros.
//!
//! * If you have experience with NumPy, you may also be interested in
//!   [`ndarray_for_numpy_users`](doc/ndarray_for_numpy_users/index.html).

/// ## `Array`
///
/// [`Array`](type.Array.html) is an owned array that owns the underlying array
/// elements directly (just like a `Vec`) and it is the default way to create and
/// store n-dimensional data. `Array<A, D>` has two type parameters: `A` for
/// the element type, and `D` for the dimensionality. A particular
/// dimensionality's type alias like `Array3<A>` just has the type parameter
/// `A` for element type.
///
/// An example:
///
/// ```
/// // Create a three-dimensional f64 array, initialized with zeros
/// use ndarray::Array3;
/// let mut temperature = Array3::<f64>::zeros((3, 4, 5));
/// // Increase the temperature in this location
/// temperature[[2, 2, 2]] += 0.5;
/// ```
///
/// ## `ArcArray`
///
/// [`ArcArray`](type.ArcArray.html) is an owned array with reference counted
/// data (shared ownership).
/// Sharing requires that it uses copy-on-write for mutable operations.
/// Calling a method for mutating elements on `ArcArray`, for example
/// [`view_mut()`](#method.view_mut) or [`get_mut()`](#method.get_mut),
/// will break sharing and require a clone of the data (if it is not uniquely held).
///
/// ## Array Views
///
/// [`ArrayView`] and [`ArrayViewMut`] are read-only and read-write array views
/// respectively. They use dimensionality, indexing, and almost all other
/// methods the same was as the other array types.
///
/// Methods for `ArrayBase` apply to array views too, when the trait bounds
/// allow.
///
/// Please see the documentation for the respective array view for an overview
/// of methods specific to array views: [`ArrayView`], [`ArrayViewMut`].
///
/// A view is created from an array using `.view()`, `.view_mut()`, using
/// slicing (`.slice()`, `.slice_mut()`) or from one of the many iterators
/// that yield array views.
///
/// You can also create an array view from a regular slice of data not
/// allocated with `Array` — see array view methods or their `From` impls.
///
/// Note that all `ArrayBase` variants can change their view (slicing) of the
/// data freely, even when their data can’t be mutated.
///
/// ## Indexing and Dimension
///
/// The dimensionality of the array determines the number of *axes*, for example
/// a 2D array has two axes. These are listed in “big endian” order, so that
/// the greatest dimension is listed first, the lowest dimension with the most
/// rapidly varying index is the last.
///
/// In a 2D array the index of each element is `[row, column]` as seen in this
/// 4 × 3 example:
///
/// ```ignore
/// [[ [0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2] ],  // row 0
///  [ [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2] ],  // row 1
///  [ [2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2] ],  // row 2
///  [ [3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2] ]]  // row 3
/// //    \       \       \
/// //   column 0  \     column 2
/// //            column 1
/// ```
///
/// The number of axes for an array is fixed by its `D` type parameter: `Ix1`
/// for a 1D array, `Ix2` for a 2D array etc. The dimension type `IxDyn` allows
/// a dynamic number of axes.
///
/// A fixed size array (`[usize; N]`) of the corresponding dimensionality is
/// used to index the `Array`, making the syntax `array[[` i, j,  ...`]]`
///
/// ```
/// use ndarray::Array2;
/// let mut array = Array2::zeros((4, 3));
/// array[[1, 1]] = 7;
/// ```
///
/// Important traits and types for dimension and indexing:
///
/// - A [`Dim`](Dim.t.html) value represents a dimensionality or index.
/// - Trait [`Dimension`](Dimension.t.html) is implemented by all
/// dimensionalities. It defines many operations for dimensions and indices.
/// - Trait [`IntoDimension`](IntoDimension.t.html) is used to convert into a
/// `Dim` value.
/// - Trait [`ShapeBuilder`](ShapeBuilder.t.html) is an extension of
/// `IntoDimension` and is used when constructing an array. A shape describes
/// not just the extent of each axis but also their strides.
/// - Trait [`NdIndex`](NdIndex.t.html) is an extension of `Dimension` and is
/// for values that can be used with indexing syntax.
///
///
/// The default memory order of an array is *row major* order (a.k.a “c” order),
/// where each row is contiguous in memory.
/// A *column major* (a.k.a. “f” or fortran) memory order array has
/// columns (or, in general, the outermost axis) with contiguous elements.
///
/// The logical order of any array’s elements is the row major order
/// (the rightmost index is varying the fastest).
/// The iterators `.iter(), .iter_mut()` always adhere to this order, for example.
///
/// ## Loops, Producers and Iterators
///
/// Using [`Zip`](struct.Zip.html) is the most general way to apply a procedure
/// across one or several arrays or *producers*.
///
/// [`NdProducer`](trait.NdProducer.html) is like an iterable but for
/// multidimensional data. All producers have dimensions and axes, like an
/// array view, and they can be split and used with parallelization using `Zip`.
///
/// For example, `ArrayView<A, D>` is a producer, it has the same dimensions
/// as the array view and for each iteration it produces a reference to
/// the array element (`&A` in this case).
///
/// Another example, if we have a 10 × 10 array and use `.exact_chunks((2, 2))`
/// we get a producer of chunks which has the dimensions 5 × 5 (because
/// there are *10 / 2 = 5* chunks in either direction). The 5 × 5 chunks producer
/// can be paired with any other producers of the same dimension with `Zip`, for
/// example 5 × 5 arrays.
///
/// ### `.iter()` and `.iter_mut()`
///
/// These are the element iterators of arrays and they produce an element
/// sequence in the logical order of the array, that means that the elements
/// will be visited in the sequence that corresponds to increasing the
/// last index first: *0, ..., 0,  0*; *0, ..., 0, 1*; *0, ...0, 2* and so on.
///
/// ### `.outer_iter()` and `.axis_iter()`
///
/// These iterators produce array views of one smaller dimension.
///
/// For example, for a 2D array, `.outer_iter()` will produce the 1D rows.
/// For a 3D array, `.outer_iter()` produces 2D subviews.
///
/// `.axis_iter()` is like `outer_iter()` but allows you to pick which
/// axis to traverse.
///
/// The `outer_iter` and `axis_iter` are one dimensional producers.
///
/// ## `.genrows()`, `.gencolumns()` and `.lanes()`
///
/// [`.genrows()`][gr] is a producer (and iterable) of all rows in an array.
///
/// ```
/// use ndarray::Array;
///
/// // 1. Loop over the rows of a 2D array
/// let mut a = Array::zeros((10, 10));
/// for mut row in a.genrows_mut() {
///     row.fill(1.);
/// }
///
/// // 2. Use Zip to pair each row in 2D `a` with elements in 1D `b`
/// use ndarray::Zip;
/// let mut b = Array::zeros((a.rows(),));
///
/// Zip::from(a.genrows())
///     .and(&mut b)
///     .apply(|a_row, b_elt| {
///         *b_elt = a_row[a.cols() - 1] - a_row[0];
///     });
/// ```
///
/// The *lanes* of an array are 1D segments along an axis and when pointed
/// along the last axis they are *rows*, when pointed along the first axis
/// they are *columns*.
///
/// A *m* × *n* array has *m* rows each of length *n* and conversely
/// *n* columns each of length *m*.
///
/// To generalize this, we say that an array of dimension *a* × *m* × *n*
/// has *a m* rows. It's composed of *a* times the previous array, so it
/// has *a* times as many rows.
///
/// All methods: [`.genrows()`][gr], [`.genrows_mut()`][grm],
/// [`.gencolumns()`][gc], [`.gencolumns_mut()`][gcm],
/// [`.lanes(axis)`][l], [`.lanes_mut(axis)`][lm].
///
/// [gr]: #method.genrows
/// [grm]: #method.genrows_mut
/// [gc]: #method.gencolumns
/// [gcm]: #method.gencolumns_mut
/// [l]: #method.lanes
/// [lm]: #method.lanes_mut
///
/// Yes, for 2D arrays `.genrows()` and `.outer_iter()` have about the same
/// effect:
///
///  + `genrows()` is a producer with *n* - 1 dimensions of 1 dimensional items
///  + `outer_iter()` is a producer with 1 dimension of *n* - 1 dimensional items
///
/// ## Slicing
///
/// You can use slicing to create a view of a subset of the data in
/// the array. Slicing methods include [`.slice()`], [`.slice_mut()`],
/// [`.slice_move()`], and [`.slice_collapse()`].
///
/// The slicing argument can be passed using the macro [`s![]`](macro.s!.html),
/// which will be used in all examples. (The explicit form is an instance of
/// [`&SliceInfo`]; see its docs for more information.)
///
/// [`&SliceInfo`]: struct.SliceInfo.html
///
/// If a range is used, the axis is preserved. If an index is used, that index
/// is selected and the axis is removed; this selects a subview. See
/// [*Subviews*](#subviews) for more information about subviews. Note that
/// [`.slice_collapse()`] behaves like [`.collapse_axis()`] by preserving
/// the number of dimensions.
///
/// [`.slice()`]: #method.slice
/// [`.slice_mut()`]: #method.slice_mut
/// [`.slice_move()`]: #method.slice_move
/// [`.slice_collapse()`]: #method.slice_collapse
///
/// It's possible to take multiple simultaneous *mutable* slices with the
/// [`multislice!()`](macro.multislice!.html) macro.
///

/// ## Subviews
///
/// Subview methods allow you to restrict the array view while removing one

/// [`.fold_axis()`], [`.axis_iter()`], [`.axis_iter_mut()`],
/// [`.outer_iter()`], and [`.outer_iter_mut()`] operate on all the subviews
/// along an axis.
///
/// A related method is [`.collapse_axis()`], which modifies the view in the
/// same way as [`.index_axis()`] except for removing the collapsed axis, since
/// it operates *in place*. The length of the axis becomes 1.

/// Let `C` be an array with mutable data (either `Array`, `ArcArray`

///
/// - `&A @ K` or `K @ &A` which produces a new `Array`

/// ### Unary Operators
///
/// Let `A` be an array or view of any kind. Let `B` be an array with owned

/// ### Conversions from Nested `Vec`s/`Array`s
///
/// It's generally a good idea to avoid nested `Vec`/`Array` types, such as
/// `Vec<Vec<A>>` or `Vec<Array2<A>>` because:
///
/// * they require extra heap allocations compared to a single `Array`,
///
/// * they can scatter data all over memory (because of multiple allocations),
///
/// * they cause unnecessary indirection (traversing multiple pointers to reach
///   the data),
///
/// * they don't enforce consistent shape within the nested
///   `Vec`s/`ArrayBase`s, and
///
/// * they are generally more difficult to work with.
///
/// The most common case where users might consider using nested
/// `Vec`s/`Array`s is when creating an array by appending rows/subviews in a
/// loop, where the rows/subviews are computed within the loop. However, there
/// are better ways than using nested `Vec`s/`Array`s.
///
/// If you know ahead-of-time the shape of the final array, the cleanest
/// solution is to allocate the final array before the loop, and then assign
/// the data to it within the loop, like this:
///
/// ```rust
/// use ndarray::{array, Array2, Axis};
///
/// let mut arr = Array2::zeros((2, 3));
/// for (i, mut row) in arr.axis_iter_mut(Axis(0)).enumerate() {
///     // Perform calculations and assign to `row`; this is a trivial example:
///     row.fill(i);
/// }
/// assert_eq!(arr, array![[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]);
/// ```
///
/// If you don't know ahead-of-time the shape of the final array, then the
/// cleanest solution is generally to append the data to a flat `Vec`, and then
/// convert it to an `Array` at the end with
/// [`::from_shape_vec()`](#method.from_shape_vec). You just have to be careful
/// that the layout of the data (the order of the elements in the flat `Vec`)
/// is correct.
///
/// ```rust
/// use ndarray::{array, Array2};
///
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<std::error::Error>> {
/// let ncols = 3;
/// let mut data = Vec::new();
/// let mut nrows = 0;
/// for i in 0..2 {
///     // Compute `row` and append it to `data`; this is a trivial example:
///     let row = vec![i; ncols];
///     data.extend_from_slice(&row);
///     nrows += 1;
/// }
/// let arr = Array2::from_shape_vec((nrows, ncols), data)?;
/// assert_eq!(arr, array![[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// If neither of these options works for you, and you really need to convert
/// nested `Vec`/`Array` instances to an `Array`, the cleanest solution is
/// generally to use
/// [`Iterator::flatten()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.flatten)
/// to get a flat `Vec`, and then convert the `Vec` to an `Array` with
/// [`::from_shape_vec()`](#method.from_shape_vec), like this:
///
/// ```rust
/// use ndarray::{array, Array2, Array3};
///
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<std::error::Error>> {
/// let nested: Vec<Array2<i32>> = vec![
///     array![[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],
///     array![[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]],
/// ];
/// let [rows, cols] = nested[0].dim();
/// let shape = (nested.len(), rows, cols);
/// let flat: Vec<i32> = nested.iter().flatten().cloned().collect();
/// let arr = Array3::from_shape_vec(shape, flat)?;
/// assert_eq!(arr, array![
///     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],
///     [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]],
/// ]);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Note that this implementation assumes that the nested `Vec`s are all the
/// same shape and that the `Vec` is non-empty. Depending on your application,
/// it may be a good idea to add checks for these assumptions and possibly
/// choose a different way to handle the empty case.
///
// # For implementors
//
// All methods must uphold the following constraints:
//
// 1. `data` must correctly represent the data buffer / ownership information,
//    `ptr` must point into the data represented by `data`, and the `dim` and
//    `strides` must be consistent with `data`. For example,
//
//    * If `data` is `OwnedRepr<A>`, all elements represented by `ptr`, `dim`,
//      and `strides` must be owned by the `Vec` and not aliased by multiple
//      indices.
//
//    * If `data` is `ViewRepr<&'a mut A>`, all elements represented by `ptr`,
//      `dim`, and `strides` must be exclusively borrowed and not aliased by
//      multiple indices.
//
// 2. `ptr` must be non-null and aligned, and it must be safe to [`.offset()`]
//    `ptr` by zero.
//
// 3. It must be safe to [`.offset()`] the pointer repeatedly along all axes
//    and calculate the `count`s for the `.offset()` calls without overflow,
//    even if the array is empty or the elements are zero-sized.
//
//    More specifically, the set of all possible (signed) offset counts
//    relative to `ptr` can be determined by the following (the casts and
//    arithmetic must not overflow):
//
//    ```rust
//    /// Returns all the possible offset `count`s relative to `ptr`.
//    fn all_offset_counts(shape: &[usize], strides: &[isize]) -> BTreeSet<isize> {
//        assert_eq!(shape.len(), strides.len());
//        let mut all_offsets = BTreeSet::<isize>::new();
//        all_offsets.insert(0);
//        for axis in 0..shape.len() {
//            let old_offsets = all_offsets.clone();
//            for index in 0..shape[axis] {
//                assert!(index <= isize::MAX as usize);
//                let off = (index as isize).checked_mul(strides[axis]).unwrap();
//                for &old_offset in &old_offsets {
//                    all_offsets.insert(old_offset.checked_add(off).unwrap());
//                }
//            }
//        }
//        all_offsets
//    }
//    ```
//
//    Note that it must be safe to offset the pointer *repeatedly* along all
//    axes, so in addition for it being safe to offset `ptr` by each of these
//    counts, the difference between the least and greatest address reachable
//    by these offsets in units of `A` and in units of bytes must not be
//    greater than `isize::MAX`.
//
//    In other words,
//
//    * All possible pointers generated by moving along all axes must be in
//      bounds or one byte past the end of a single allocation with element
//      type `A`. The only exceptions are if the array is empty or the element
//      type is zero-sized. In these cases, `ptr` may be dangling, but it must
//      still be safe to [`.offset()`] the pointer along the axes.
//
//    * The offset in units of bytes between the least address and greatest
//      address by moving along all axes must not exceed `isize::MAX`. This
//      constraint prevents the computed offset, in bytes, from overflowing
//      `isize` regardless of the starting point due to past offsets.
//
//    * The offset in units of `A` between the least address and greatest
//      address by moving along all axes must not exceed `isize::MAX`. This
//      constraint prevents overflow when calculating the `count` parameter to
//      [`.offset()`] regardless of the starting point due to past offsets.
//
//    For example, if the shape is [2, 0, 3] and the strides are [3, 6, -1],
//    the offsets of interest relative to `ptr` are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. So,
//    `ptr.offset(-2)`, `ptr.offset(-1)`, …, `ptr.offset(3)` must be pointers
//    within a single allocation with element type `A`; `(3 - (-2)) *
//    size_of::<A>()` must not exceed `isize::MAX`, and `3 - (-2)` must not
//    exceed `isize::MAX`. Note that this is a requirement even though the
//    array is empty (axis 1 has length 0).
//
//    A dangling pointer can be used when creating an empty array, but this
//    usually means all the strides have to be zero. A dangling pointer that
//    can safely be offset by zero bytes can be constructed with
//    `::std::ptr::NonNull::<A>::dangling().as_ptr()`. (It isn't entirely clear
//    from the documentation that a pointer created this way is safe to
//    `.offset()` at all, even by zero bytes, but the implementation of
//    `Vec<A>` does this, so we can too. See rust-lang/rust#54857 for details.)
//
// 4. The product of non-zero axis lengths must not exceed `isize::MAX`. (This
//    also implies that the length of any individual axis must not exceed
//    `isize::MAX`, and an array can contain at most `isize::MAX` elements.)
//    This constraint makes various calculations easier because they don't have
//    to worry about overflow and axis lengths can be freely cast to `isize`.
//
// Constraints 2–4 are carefully designed such that if they're upheld for the
// array, they're also upheld for any subset of axes of the array as well as
// slices/subviews/reshapes of the array. This is important for iterators that
// produce subviews (and other similar cases) to be safe without extra (easy to
// forget) checks for zero-length axes. Constraint 1 is similarly upheld for
// any subset of axes and slices/subviews/reshapes, except when removing a
// zero-length axis (since if the other axes are non-zero-length, that would
// allow accessing elements that should not be possible to access).
//
// Method/function implementations can rely on these constraints being upheld.
// The constraints can be temporarily violated within a method/function
// implementation since `ArrayBase` doesn't implement `Drop` and `&mut
// ArrayBase` is `!UnwindSafe`, but the implementation must not call
// methods/functions on the array while it violates the constraints.
//
// Users of the `ndarray` crate cannot rely on these constraints because they
// may change in the future.
