/// Extra indexing methods for array views
///
/// These methods are very similar to regular indexing or calling of the
/// `get`/`get_mut` methods that we can use on any array or array view. The
/// difference here is in the length of lifetime in the resulting reference.
///
/// **Note** that the `ArrayView` (read-only) and `ArrayViewMut` (read-write) differ
/// in how they are allowed implement this trait -- `ArrayView`'s implementation
/// is usual. If you put in a `ArrayView<'a, T, D>` here, you get references
/// `&'a T` out.
///
/// For `ArrayViewMut` to obey the borrowing rules we have to consume the
/// view if we call any of these methods. (The equivalent of reborrow is
/// `.view_mut()` for read-write array views, but if you can use that,
/// then the regular indexing / `get_mut` should suffice, too.)
