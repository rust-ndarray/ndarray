- Support two-sided broadcasting in arithmetic operations with arrays by [@SparrowLii]

  This now allows, for example, addition of a 3 x 1 with a 1 x 3 array; the
  operands are in this case broadcast to 3 x 3 which is the shape of the result.

  Note that this means that a new trait bound is required in some places when
  mixing dimensionality types of arrays in arithmetic operations.

  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/898

- Support for compiling ndarray as `no_std` (using core and alloc) by
  [@xd009642] and [@bluss]

  elements through shared views and broadcast views, by [@bluss].

  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/877

- New methods `slice_each_axis/_mut/_inplace` that make it easier to slice
  a dynamic number of axes in some situations, by [@jturner314]

  [@jturner314]

  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/890

API changes
-----------

  No new functionality, just that these constructors are available without trait
  imports.

  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/921

- `NdProducer::raw_dim` is now a documented method by [@jturner314]

  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/918

- `AxisDescription` is now a struct with field names, not a tuple struct by
  [@jturner314]. Its accessor methods are now deprecated.

  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/915

- Methods for array comparison `abs_diff_eq` and `relative_eq` are now
  exposed as inherent methods too (no trait import needed), still under the approx
  feature flag by [@bluss]

  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/946

- Changes to the slicing-related types and macro by [@jturner314] and [@bluss]:

  - Remove the `Dimension::SliceArg` associated type, and add a new `SliceArg`
    trait for this purpose.
  - Change the return type of the `s![]` macro to an owned `SliceInfo` rather
    than a reference.
  - Replace the `SliceOrIndex` enum with `SliceInfoElem`, which has an
    additional `NewAxis` variant and does not have a `step_by` method.
  - Change the type parameters of `SliceInfo` in order to support the `NewAxis`
    functionality and remove some tricky `unsafe` code.
  - Mark the `SliceInfo::new` method as `unsafe`. The new implementations of
    `TryFrom` can be used as a safe alternative.
  - Remove the `AsRef<SliceInfo<[SliceOrIndex], D>> for SliceInfo<T, D>`
    implementation. Add the similar `From<&'a SliceInfo<T, Din, Dout>> for
    SliceInfo<&'a [SliceInfoElem], Din, Dout>` conversion as an alternative.
  - Change the *expr* `;` *step* case in the `s![]` macro to error at compile
    time if an unsupported type for *expr* is used, instead of panicking at
    runtime.

Version 0.14.0 (2020-11-28)
===========================

New features
------------

- `Zip::apply_collect` and `Zip::par_apply_collect` now support all
  elements (not just `Copy` elements) by [@bluss]
  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/814  
  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/817

- New function `stack` by [@andrei-papou]  
  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/844  
  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/850

Enhancements
------------

- Handle inhomogeneous shape inputs better in Zip, in practice: guess better whether
  to prefer c- or f-order for the inner loop by [@bluss]
  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/809

- Improve code sharing in some commonly used code by [@bluss]
  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/819

API changes
-----------

- The **old function** `stack` has been renamed to `concatenate`.
  A new function `stack` with numpy-like semantics have taken its place.
  Old usages of `stack` should change to use `concatenate`.
  
  `concatenate` produces an array with the same number of axes as the inputs.  
  `stack` produces an array that has one more axis than the inputs.

  This change was unfortunately done without a deprecation period, due to the long period between releases.

  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/844  
  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/850

- Enum ErrorKind is now properly non-exhaustive and has lost its old placeholder invalid variant. By [@Zuse64]
  https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/848

- Remove deprecated items:

  - RcArray (deprecated alias for ArcArray)
  - Removed `subview_inplace` use `collapse_axis`
  - Removed `subview_mut` use `index_axis_mut`
  - Removed `into_subview` use `index_axis_move`
  - Removed `subview` use `index_axis`
  - Removed `slice_inplace` use `slice_collapse`

- Undeprecated `remove_axis` because its replacement is hard to find out on your own.

- Update public external dependencies to new versions by [@Eijebong] and [@bluss]

  - num-complex 0.3
  - approx 0.4 (optional)
  - blas-src 0.6.1 and openblas-src 0.9.0 (optional)

  - Add `first` and `first_mut` methods for getting the first element of an array.
  - Add `into_scalar` method for converting an `Array0` into its element.
  - Add `insert_axis_inplace` and `index_axis_inplace` methods for inserting and
    removing axes in dynamic-dimensional (`IxDyn`) arrays without taking ownership.
  - Add `stride_of` method for getting the stride of an axis.
  - Add public `ndim` and `zeros` methods to `Dimension` trait.
  - Rename `scalar_sum` to `sum`, `subview` to `index_axis`,
    `subview_mut` to `index_axis_mut`, `subview_inplace` to
    `collapse_axis`, `into_subview` to `index_axis_move`, and
    `slice_inplace` to `slice_collapse` (deprecating the old names,
    except for `scalar_sum` which will be in 0.13).

  - Implement `Clone` for `LanesIter`.
  - Implement `Debug`, `Copy`, and `Clone` for `FoldWhile`.
  - Relax constraints on `sum_axis`, `mean_axis`, and `into_owned`.

    This fixes undefined behavior in some edge cases.
    (See [#543](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/543).)
  - Fix `is_standard_layout` in some edge cases.
    (See [#543](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/543).)

  - Improve documentation by @jturner314, @bluss, and @paulkernfeld.
  - Improve element iterators with implementations of `Iterator::rfold`.
  - Miscellaneous internal implementation improvements by @jturner314 and @bluss.


Version 0.12.0 (2018-09-01)
===========================

  - Add `var_axis` method for computing variance by @LukeMathWalker.
  - Add `map_mut` and `map_axis_mut` methods (mutable variants of `map` and `map_axis`) by @LukeMathWalker.
  - Add support for 128-bit integer scalars (`i128` and `u128`).
  - Add support for slicing with inclusive ranges (`start..=end` and `..=end`).

Version 0.11.2 (2018-03-21)
===========================

  - New documentation; @jturner314 has written a large “ndarray for NumPy users”
    document, which we include in rustdoc.
    [Read it here](https://docs.rs/ndarray/0.11/ndarray/doc/ndarray_for_numpy_users/)
    a useful quick guide for any user, and in particular if you are familiar
    with numpy.
  - Add `ArcArray`. `RcArray` has become `ArcArray`; it is now using thread
    safe reference counting just like `Arc`; this means that shared ownership
    arrays are now `Send/Sync` if the corresponding element type is `Send
    + Sync`.
  - Add array method `.permute_axes()` by @jturner314
  - Add array constructor `Array::ones` by @ehsanmok
  - Add the method `.reborrow()` to `ArrayView/Mut`, which can be used
    to shorten the lifetime of an array view; in a reference-like type this
    normally happens implicitly but for technical reasons the views have
    an invariant lifetime parameter.
  - Fix an issue with type inference, the dimensionality of an array
    should not infer correctly in more cases when using slicing. By @jturner314.


Version 0.11.1 (2018-01-21)
===========================

  - Dimension types (`Ix1, Ix2, .., IxDyn`) now implement `Hash` by
    @jturner314
  - Blas integration can now use *gemv* for matrix-vector multiplication also
    when the matrix is f-order by @maciejkula

    from the `unsafe_code` lint by @jturner314

Version 0.11.0 (2017-12-29)
===========================

[Release announcement](https://jim.turner.link/pages/ndarray-0.11/)

  - Allow combined slicing and subviews in a single operation by @jturner314 and
    @bluss

    * Add support for individual indices (to indicate subviews) to the `s![]`
      macro, and change the return type to
      `&SliceInfo<[SliceOrIndex; n], Do>`.
    * Change the argument type of the slicing methods to correspond to the new
      `s![]` macro.
    * Replace the `Si` type with `SliceOrIndex`.
    * Add a new `Slice` type that is similar to the old `Si` type.

  - Add support for more index types (e.g. `usize`) to the `s![]` macro by
    @jturner314
  - Rename `.islice()` to `.slice_inplace()` by @jturner314
  - Rename `.isubview()` to `.subview_inplace()` by @jturner314

    `.slice_axis_inplace()` methods by @jturner314
  - Add `Dimension::NDIM` associated constant by @jturner314
  - Change trait bounds for arithmetic ops between an array (by value) and
    a reference to an array or array view (“array1 (op) &array2”); before,
    an `ArrayViewMut` was supported on the left hand side, now, the left
    hand side must not be a view.
    ([#380](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/380)) by @jturner314
  - Remove deprecated methods (`.whole_chunks()`, `.whole_chunks_mut()`,
    `.sum()`, and `.mean()`; replaced by `.exact_chunks()`,
    `.exact_chunks_mut()`, `.sum_axis()`, and `.mean_axis()`,
    respectively) by @bluss
  - Updated to the latest blas (optional) dependencies. See instructions in the
    README.
  - Minimum required Rust version is 1.22.

    [`IxDyn`](https://docs.rs/ndarray/0.8.2/ndarray/type.IxDyn.html).
    `IxDyn` will have a representation change next incompatible
    version. Use it as a type alias for best forward compatibility.
  - Add iterable and producer `.whole_chunks_mut(size)`.
  - Fix a bug in `whole_chunks`: it didn't check the dimensionality of the
    requested chunk size properly (an `IxDyn`-only bug).

    + Apart from array views, axis iterators and the whole chunks iterable are
      also producers

  - Add constructor `Array::uninitialized`

  - Big overhaul of dimensions: Add type `Dim` with aliases
    `Ix1, Ix2, Ix3, ...` etc for specific dimensionalities.
    Instead of `Ix` for dimension use `Ix1`, instead of `(Ix, Ix)` use
    `Ix2`, and so on.
  - The dimension type `Dim` supports indexing and arithmetic. See
    `Dimension` trait for new methods and inherited traits.

    of the array types themselves.)

- 0.6.7

  - Improve performance of a lot of basic operations for arrays where
    the innermost dimension is not contiguous (`.fold(), .map(),
    .to_owned()`, arithmetic operations with scalars).
  - Require Rust 1.11

  - Add dimensionality specific type aliases: `Array0, Array1, Array2, ...`
    and so on (there are many), also `Ix0, Ix1, Ix2, ...`.

    was moved to the crate `ndarray-rblas`.
  - Add array methods `as_slice_memory_order, as_slice_memory_order_mut, as_ptr,
    as_mut_ptr`.
  - Deprecate `raw_data, raw_data_mut`.
  - Add `Send + Sync` to `NdFloat`.
  - Arrays now show shape & stride in their debug formatter.
  - Fix a bug where `from_vec_dim_stride` did not accept arrays with unitary axes.
  - Performance improvements for contiguous arrays in non-c order when using
    methods `to_owned, map, scalar_sum, assign_scalar`,
    and arithmetic operations between array and scalar.
  - Some methods now return arrays in the same memory order of the input
    if the input is contiguous: `to_owned, map, mat_mul` (matrix multiplication
    only if both inputs are the same memory order), and arithmetic operations
    that allocate a new result.
  - Slight performance improvements in `dot, mat_mul` due to more efficient
    glue code for calling BLAS.
  - Performance improvements in `.assign_scalar`.

- 0.4.1

  - Mark iterators `Send + Sync` when possible.

- **0.4.0** [Release Announcement](http://bluss.github.io/rust/2016/03/06/ndarray-0.4/)

  - New array splitting via `.split_at(Axis, Ix)` and `.axis_chunks_iter()`
  - Added traits `NdFloat`, `AsArray` and `From for ArrayView` which
    improve generic programming.
  - Array constructors panic when attempting to create an array whose element
    count overflows `usize`. (Would be a debug assertion for overflow before.)
  - Performance improvements for `.map()`.
  - Added `stack` and macro `stack![axis, arrays..]` to concatenate arrays.
  - Added constructor `OwnedArray::range(start, end, step)`.
  - The type alias `Array` was renamed to `RcArray` (and the old name deprecated).
  - Binary operators are not defined when consuming a mutable array view as
    the left hand side argument anymore.
  - Remove methods and items deprecated since 0.3 or earlier; deprecated methods
    have notes about replacements in 0.3 docs.
  - See below for full changelog through alphas.

- 0.4.0-alpha.8

  - In debug mode, indexing an array out of bounds now has a detailed
    message about index and shape. (In release mode it does not.)
  - Enable assign_ops feature automatically when it is supported (Rust 1.8 beta
    or later).
  - Add trait `NdFloat` which makes it easy to be generic over `f32, f64`.
  - Add `From` implementations that convert slices or references to arrays
    into array views. This replaces `from_slice` from a previous alpha.
  - Add `AsArray` trait, which is simply based on those `From` implementations.
  - Improve `.map()` so that it can autovectorize.
  - Use `Axis` argument in `RemoveAxis` too.
  - Require `DataOwned` in the raw data methods.
  - Merged error types into a single `ShapeError`, which uses no allocated data.

- 0.4.0-alpha.7

  - Fix too strict lifetime bound in arithmetic operations like `&a @ &b`.
  - Rename trait Scalar to ScalarOperand (and improve its docs).
  - Implement <<= and >>= for arrays.

- 0.4.0-alpha.6

  - All axis arguments must now be wrapped in newtype `Axis`.
  - Add method `.split_at(Axis, Ix)` to read-only and read-write array views.
  - Add constructors `ArrayView{,Mut}::from_slice` and array view methods
    are now visible in the docs.

- 0.4.0-alpha.5

  - Use new trait `LinalgScalar` for operations where we want type-based specialization.
    This shrinks the set of types that allow dot product, matrix multiply, mean.
  - Use BLAS acceleration transparently in `.dot()` (this is the first step).
  - Only OwnedArray and RcArray and not ArrayViewMut can now be used as consumed
    left hand operand for arithmetic operators. [See arithmetic operations docs!](
    https://docs.rs/ndarray/0.4.0-alpha.5/ndarray/struct.ArrayBase.html#arithmetic-operations)
  - Remove deprecated module `linalg` (it was already mostly empty)
  - Deprecate free function `zeros` in favour of static method `zeros`.

- 0.4.0-alpha.4

  - Rename `Array` to `RcArray`. Old name is deprecated.
  - Add methods `OuterIter::split_at`, `OuterIterMut::split_at`
  - Change `arr0, arr1, arr2, arr3` to return `OwnedArray`.
    Add `rcarr1, rcarr2, rcarr3` that return `RcArray`.

- 0.4.0-alpha.3

  - Improve arithmetic operations where the RHS is a broadcast 0-dimensional
    array.
  - Add read-only and read-write array views to the `rblas` integration.
    Added methods `AsBlas::{blas_view_checked, blas_view_mut_checked, bv, bvm}`.
  - Use hash_slice in `Hash` impl for arrays.

- 0.4.0-alpha.2

  - Add `ArrayBase::reversed_axes` which transposes an array.

- 0.4.0-alpha.1

  - Add checked and unchecked constructor methods for creating arrays
    from a vector and explicit dimension and stride, or with
    fortran (column major) memory order (marked `f`):
    
    + `ArrayBase::from_vec_dim`, `from_vec_dim_stride`,
      `from_vec_dim_stride_unchecked`,
    + `from_vec_dim_unchecked_f`, `from_elem_f`, `zeros_f`
    + View constructors `ArrayView::from_slice_dim_stride`,
      `ArrayViewMut::from_slice_dim_stride`.
    + Rename old `ArrayBase::from_vec_dim` to `from_vec_dim_unchecked`.

  - Check better for wraparound when computing the number of elements in a shape;
    this adds error cases that **panic** in `from_elem`, `zeros` etc,
    however *the new check will only ever panic in cases that would
    trigger debug assertions for overflow in the previous versions*!.
  - Add an array chunks iterator `.axis_chunks_iter()` and mutable version;
    it allows traversing the array in for example chunks of *n* rows at a time.
  - Remove methods and items deprecated since 0.3 or earlier; deprecated methods
    have notes about replacements in 0.3 docs.

  - **Note:** PACKAGE NAME CHANGED TO `ndarray`. Having package != crate ran
    into many quirks of various tools. Changing the package name is easier for
    everyone involved!
  - Optimized `scalar_sum()` so that it will vectorize for the floating point
    element case too.

- 0.2.0-alpha.7

  - Optimized arithmetic operations!

    - For c-contiguous arrays or arrays with c-contiguous lowest dimension
      they optimize very well, and can vectorize!

- 0.2.0-alpha.4

  - Slicing methods like `.slice()` now take a fixed size array of `Si`
    as the slice description. This allows more type checking to verify that the
    number of axes is correct.
  - Add experimental `rblas` integration.
  - Add `into_shape()` which allows reshaping any array or view kind.

- 0.2.0-alpha.3

  - Add and edit a lot of documentation

- 0.2.0-alpha.2

  - Improve performance for iterators when the array data is in the default
    memory layout. The iterator then wraps the default slice iterator and
    loops will autovectorize.
  - Remove method `.indexed()` on iterators. Changed `Indexed` and added
    `ÌndexedMut`.
  - Added `.as_slice(), .as_mut_slice()`
